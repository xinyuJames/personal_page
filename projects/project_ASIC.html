                    The projects are done under <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/Academics/Undergraduates/UGO/CourseInfo/courseInfo?courseid=389.0&show=true&type=undergrad">ECE337: ASIC Design Lab</a>. This is a course with the most workload I had so far.

                    Totally three designs are made: UART Receiver + APB; FIR-filter + AHB; and USB 1.1 Bulk Transfer Type.

                <p>
                    This project is done in a group of 3. Each member is responsible for one part of the design: AHB subordinate, Receiver, Transmitter + Data Buffer.

                <p>
                    I am responsible for AHB subordinate, with Burst Transfer implemented. The burst transfer and hready is implemented according to chapter 3.6 and 3.7 from <a href="../files/ASIC_IHI0033C_amba_ahb_protocol_spec.pdf">this</a>.

                    FIR filter stands for Finite Impulse Response filter. According to the name, we can know that it is like a impulse sampling train with parameter in it. The implementation of this filter is 4-point filter with high pass behaviour. The image below shows the mathematical implementation. This implementation also has a AHB subordinate to communicate with the manager.

                    APB is also a Bus Protocal. The difference between this and the AHB is that AHB pipelined the address and data phase, while APB read address first and then read the data.
